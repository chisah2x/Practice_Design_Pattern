Facade Design Pattern
- A facade acts as a layer around a system, making it easier for clients to interact with complex components.
- It reduces tight coupling between clients and system components, converting complex interfaces into simpler ones.

Intent and Structure
- The primary intent of the facade pattern is to provide a higher-level interface that simplifies subsystem usage.
- Facades can be implemented as functions, classes, or sets of classes, and multiple facades can exist for different functionalities.

Types of Facades
- Transparent facades allow clients direct access to underlying classes, while opaque facades hide these classes, making them essential for client interaction.
- Facades may pass client requests to underlying classes and can perform additional processing as needed.

Advantages and Disadvantages
- Advantages include weak coupling, allowing underlying components to change without affecting clients, and reduced compilation dependencies.
- Disadvantages may arise from overusing the pattern, leading to excessive layers and potential performance degradation.

When to Use the Façade Pattern
- It is beneficial for creating simple interfaces for complex systems, especially when working with low-level functions or when team members have varying experience levels.
- The pattern can also help manage dependencies between clients and implementation classes effectively.
