Adapter Design Pattern:

**Structure of the Adapter Pattern**
- **Object Adapter**: Adapts an incompatible interface by composing the adaptee and inheriting from the target.
- **Class Adapter**: Inherits from both the target and the adaptee, allowing direct method calls.

**Advantages of Object Adapter**
- **Multiple Class Compatibility**: Can adapt to multiple classes in a hierarchy.
- **Adaptation of Hidden Classes**: Can adapt to existing classes even if they are hidden.

**Disadvantages of Object Adapter**
- **No Behavior Override**: Cannot override the behavior of the adaptee.
- **Pointer Indirection**: Method calls are made through pointers, which may add complexity.

**Advantages of Class Adapter**
- **Direct Method Calls**: Inherits methods directly, eliminating pointer indirection.
- **Behavior Override**: Can override the behavior of the adaptee.
Private Inheritance Option: By using private inheritance, methods from the adaptee can be hidden from clients, preventing access to certain functions.

**Disadvantages of Class Adapter**
- **Inheritance Limitations**: Cannot be used with final or sealed classes.
- **Language Support**: Not all programming languages support multiple inheritance.

**When to Use the Adapter Pattern**
- **Incompatible Interfaces**: Use when needing to work with existing components that have incompatible interfaces.
- **Hierarchy Adaptation**: Useful for adapting classes from an existing hierarchy.


Key Differences:

Flexibility: Inheritance provides more flexibility for modifying behavior through overriding, while composition promotes encapsulation and reusability without altering the original class.
Coupling: Inheritance creates a tighter coupling between classes, whereas composition allows for looser coupling, making it easier to change or replace components.
