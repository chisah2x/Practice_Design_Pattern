Covariance in C++ is a concept that allows a derived class to be used in place of a base class, particularly when dealing with return types in functions. This means that if a function in a base class returns a pointer or reference to a base class type, a derived class can override that function to return a pointer or reference to a derived class type. This is particularly useful in object-oriented programming, as it allows for more flexible and reusable code.

Imagine you have a base class called `Animal` and a derived class called `Dog`. If the base class has a method that returns an `Animal*`, the derived class can override this method to return a `Dog*`. This way, you can call the method on a `Dog` object and get a `Dog*` back, while still being able to use it in contexts that expect an `Animal*`.
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual Animal* makeSound() {
        // Base class implementation
        return new Animal();
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog* makeSound() override { // Covariant return type
        // Derived class implementation
        return new Dog();
    }
};
```
Without covariance in C++, 
1. **Type Mismatch**: If a derived class method cannot return a more specific type than the base class method, you would have to return the base class type. This can lead to a loss of specificity and make the code less intuitive.
2. **Downcasting**: You would often need to perform downcasting to convert the base class pointer or reference back to the derived class type. This can introduce runtime errors if the object is not actually of the derived type, leading to potential crashes or undefined behavior.
3. **Reduced Flexibility**: The inability to use covariant return types would reduce the flexibility of your class hierarchy. You would be forced to design your classes in a way that may not align with the natural relationships between base and derived classes.
4. **Code Clarity**: The code may become less clear and more cumbersome, as developers would need to handle type conversions explicitly, making it harder to read and maintain.
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual Animal* makeSound() {
        return new Animal();
    }
};
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    // Without covariance, this would not be allowed
    // Animal* makeSound() override { return new Dog(); }
};
```
