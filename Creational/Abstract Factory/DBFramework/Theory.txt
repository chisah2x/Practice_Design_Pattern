The course content discusses the challenges of creating instances of different database classes in a flexible and maintainable way.

Database Class Instantiation Challenges
- The use of preprocessor directives to create instances of SQL and MySQL connections can lead to code that is difficult to maintain.
- This approach fixes the database type at compile time, limiting runtime flexibility in choosing the database.

Conditional Statements as a Solution
- Replacing preprocessor directives with conditional statements improves readability but still complicates maintenance, especially when adding new databases.
- There is a risk of bugs being introduced when modifying multiple parts of the code to support new database types.

Enforcing Consistency in Database Usage
- The current implementation does not prevent users from mixing database classes, which can lead to runtime errors.
- A factory method will be implemented to ensure that instances are created consistently from the same database set, enhancing code reliability.



The course content focuses on implementing the Factory Method and Abstract Factory design patterns in modern C++ to improve code maintainability and flexibility.
Factory Method Pattern
- The Factory Method allows instantiation of classes without depending on their concrete types, reducing tight coupling in the code.
- It creates instances based on specified types (e.g., SQL or MySQL) but does not ensure that instances belong to the same database context.

Abstract Factory Pattern
- The Abstract Factory pattern addresses the limitation of the Factory Method by creating specific factories for each database type (e.g., SQLFactory and MySQLFactory).
- It enforces that instances created by the same factory are from the same database, preventing mixing of classes from different databases.

Implementation Steps
- The course demonstrates how to implement these patterns in code, ensuring that the client code can create instances of command and connection classes while maintaining a single database context.
